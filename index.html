                <h3>General info</h3>
                <p>I'm an student at Politechnika Śląska in Gliwice, where I study computer science. I enjoy listening to music, playing football and
                    basketball and playing computer games.

                <h3>How I started</h3>
                <p>
                    I began my story with programming when I was just 12 years old. My teacher told me about HTML. I
                    created a website about a game series using only HTML.
                    Two years later I've been told about Scratch. It's a visual programming language and enviroment to
                    create simple games in 2D connecting logical blocks.
                    I created a few bigger projects using it. In high school I learned proper HTML and CSS. A few months
                    later I was showed the basics of PHP and JS.

                <h3>What I enjoy making</h3>
                <p>I enjoy creating projects, that require inventing logical algorythms, which I can implement in basic
                    languages like javascript without any libraries. That's
                    how i came up with sudoku solver, snake game or rubiks cube timer. However I also like to learn new
                    libraries and frameworks. I learned bootstrap, which I use
                    when I don't have to focus on frontend. I also enjoy creating simple games alone, or some bigger
                    ones in a group.
